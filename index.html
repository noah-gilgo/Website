                    My name is Noah Gilgo, as you could likely guess from the domain name of this website. I am <script>document.write(howOldAmI());</script> years old and like 
                    to spend most of my time coding, with the rest of my spare time spent reading, jogging, gardening, and spending time with my family. I currently live in Hampstead, 
                    a town 20 miles northeast of Wilmington, North Carolina, where I attended college at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington.

                    As a recent graduate from the University of North Carolina at Wilmington with a B.S. in Computer Science, I have been searching diligently for real-world 
                    experience in the field of software development. I have also been keeping old skills fresh such as Java, Python and HTML, as well as acquiring new skills such as 
                    C++, CSS, and JavaScript. Currently I work at nCino, a cloud banking software company, at its headquarters in Wilmington as an Associate QA Engineer.

                    This website is my most recent project; most of my projects up to this point have revolved around scientific computing and backend development, so I wanted to 
                    start a project that would help me build upon my front-end development skills. While I have had the website for a long time, I have just recently moved it onto
                    Bluehost and have started publishing the changes I make to it on GitHub. The earliest version of this webpage was hosted on a xampp server from an old computer
                    in my bedroom: the original webpage can be found <a href="old_index.html">here.</a> While I personally like the webpage, I feel that it's a bit chaotic in
                    terms of structure, so I would like to start anew using more refined webpage-building principles.
