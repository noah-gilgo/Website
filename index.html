                    My name is Noah Gilgo, as you could likely guess from the domain name of this website. As a recent graduate from the University of North Carolina at Wilmington
                    with a B.S. in Computer Science, I have been searching diligently for real-world experience in the field of software development. I have also been keeping old
                    skills fresh such as Java, Python and HTML, as well as acquiring new skills such as C++, CSS, and JavaScript.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Born in Alabama and raised in Chicago, Jemison graduated from Stanford University with degrees in chemical engineering as well as African and African-American 
                    studies. She then earned her medical degree from Cornell University. Jemison was a doctor for the Peace Corps in Liberia and Sierra Leone from 1983 until 1985 
                    and worked as a general practitioner. In pursuit of becoming an astronaut, she applied to NASA.

                    Jemison left NASA in 1993 and founded a technology research company. She later formed a non-profit educational foundation and through the foundation is the 
                    principal of the 100 Year Starship project funded by DARPA. Jemison also wrote several books for children and appeared on television several times, including in 
                    a 1993 episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation. She holds several honorary doctorates and has been inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame and the 
                    International Space Hall of Fame.
