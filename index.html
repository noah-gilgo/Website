                    My name is Noah Gilgo, as you could likely guess from the domain name of this website.

                    As a recent graduate from the University of North Carolina at Wilmington with a B.S. in Computer Science, I have been searching diligently for real-world 
                    experience in the field of software development. I have also been keeping old skills fresh such as Java, Python and HTML, as well as acquiring new skills such as 
                    C++, CSS, and JavaScript.
                </p>

                    Jemison left NASA in 1993 and founded a technology research company. She later formed a non-profit educational foundation and through the foundation is the

                    a 1993 episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation. She holds several honorary doctorates and has been inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame and the
